		<h1>Introduction to Maze Wars</h1>
		
		<p>You are a giant, floating, killer eyeball trapped in a maze with other killer eyeballs. The goal of Maze 
		Wars is to shoot everyone else you find in the maze, before they shoot you. There are no weapons, but you can 
		shoot. You just can. Yes, the bullets are invisible, but they're still lethal – every hit is fatal. Killed 
		players reappear at a random point in the maze. Play continues until someone reaches a score of 
		<span class="maximum-score">??</span> points. Here and there in the maze are places with a blue circle on the 
		floor. Those are teleports. Step on them and you're instantly, randomly relocated. They can get you out of 
		trouble, or into it. You never know.
		</p>
		
		<p>Use the keys shown below to move and shoot. (The letter keys represent the original key mappings of the 
		circa 1987 Macintosh version of MazeWars. The arrow keys and keypad mappings are new to this version.) As an 
		experiment, you can also move by clicking on the walls and floor, or by using a scrollwheel, and you can shoot 
		by clicking on your target. However, using the keyboard is almost always faster than using the mouse.
		</p>

			<p>If you see this message, instead of a keyboard diagram, your browser does not support the 
			<a href="http://w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a>'s <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/">Scalable 
			Vector Graphics</a> (SVG) specification (which dates back to 1999), and therefore you will not be able to 
			play this game. Please upgrade to a browser that does support SVG, like the latest versions of 
			<a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">Safari</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/">Chrome</a> 
			and <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/">Firefox</a>.</p>

		<p><span class="note">Note:</span> <i>If the keys don't seem to work, the browser is probably sending the 
		keystrokes to its address bar. Click somewhere on the maze to correct that.
		</i></p>

		<p>The maze dimensions are authentic, but the layout is not – it is randomly generated for each game. Also new
		to the game is that there will always be at least <span class="minimum-players">??</span> players, even if 
		they're all bots. As humans enter the game, the bots with the highest scores drop out. If humans exit, and the 
		number of players falls below <span class="minimum-players">??</span>, new bots enter the game to keep it 
		interesting. The bots aren't smart or particularly fast, but they are thorough, so they can keep you on your 
		toes. To exit the game, just close your browser window. Within a few minutes your eyeball will be automatically 
		removed from the maze.
