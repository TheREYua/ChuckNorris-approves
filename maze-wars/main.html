		<h1>Welcome to Maze Wars!</h1>
		
		<p>This is a web-based Maze Wars game inspired by the version written for Macintosh, circa 1987, author
		unknown. That, in turn, was inspired by the 
		<a href="http://www.digibarn.com/history/04-VCF7-MazeWar/index.html">first Maze War game</a>, which was created
		in 1973 by Steve Colley, Howard Palmer and Greg Thompson. This implemetation is released under the 
		<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GNU General Public License</a>. The source code can be found at
		the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mazewarssvg/">project's home on SourceForge</a>.
		</p>
		
		<p>This version is as true to the quick, simple gameplay of the Macintosh Maze Wars as fuzzy memories, 
		and some surviving graphics files, could make it. It is easy to imagine many &ldquo;improvements&rdquo;, but
		Maze Wars seems to work best when the game play is kept simple and fast.
